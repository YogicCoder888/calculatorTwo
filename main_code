  Returns:
   Returns the result of the mathematical operation between two numbers.
   + creates addition operation between the numbers.
   - creates subtraction operation between the numbers.
   * creates multiplication operation between the numbers
   / creates division between the numbers
   P creates to the power of between numbers
   M creates the modulo for working out remainders
   S creates the square root of a number
   A creates operation for area of a circle
   % creates percentage operation between numbers
